# Wine Quality Prediction 

#### Aim:
To predict the quality of wine from a given dataset by implying various machine learning models.

#### Dataset:
Find the 'winequalityN.csv' file which is used as the dataset for performing the machine learning(ML) model.

##### Procedure: 
We begin by cleaning the data, exploring data, visualizing the data, standardize it, and atlast run various machine learning(ML) models to perform accurate predictions. '

#### Result
Find the 'Wine Quality Prediction Project.ipynb' file to find the final output.
